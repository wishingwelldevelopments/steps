"description": "bio-energetically links to carbon, oxygen and hydrogen – central to physiology, especially in their roles in carbohydrate and sugar metabolism, regulating the body’s energy use. c-o-h also affect the way the body uses fat, so es13 correlates with energy production and is intimately tied to the citric acid cycle (krebs cycle).correlates to many crucial elements and compounds related to the body’s energy-production process eg. lipotropin, a hormone that promotes the body’s use of fats; atp, a nucleotide that is a major player in how cells get and use chemical energy; thyroxin, an essential mineral in thyroid hormones; and pyruvic acid, a compound important in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. supports toxin excretion, thus aids cellular metabolism and correlates it to the liver and pancreas. connects via the body-field to lactic acid production in muscles and calcium metabolism, especially in relation to the creation of stones, such as kidney stones. nes matching tests suggest a connection between osteoarthritis and impaired carbohydrate metabolism at the bio-energetic level.",
